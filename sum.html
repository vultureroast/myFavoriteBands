<article id="sumPara">
		<p>Sum 41 is a rock band from Ajax, Ontario, Canada. Originally called Kaspir, the band formed in 1996 and currently consists of lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck "Bizzy D" Whibley, lead guitarists/backup vocalists Dave "Brownsound" Baksh and Tom "Brown Tom" Thacker, bassist/backing vocalist Jason "Cone" McCaslin and drummer Frank Zummo.</p>
		<p>In 1999, the band signed an international record deal with Island Records and released its first EP, Half Hour of Power, in 2000. The band released its debut album, All Killer, No Filler in 2001. The album achieved mainstream success with its first single, "Fat Lip", which reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and remains the band's most successful single to date. The album's following singles "In Too Deep" and "Motivation" also achieved commercial success. All Killer, No Filler was certified platinum in the United States, in Canada and in the United Kingdom. In 2002, the band released Does This Look Infected?, which was also a commercial and critical success. The singles "The Hell Song" and "Still Waiting" both charted highly on the modern rock charts. The band released its next album, Chuck, in 2004, led by singles "We're All to Blame" and "Pieces". The album proved successful, peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and sold five million copies worldwide. In 2007, the band released Underclass Hero, which was met with a mixed reception, but gained some commercial success, becoming the band's highest charting album to date. It was also the band's last album on Aquarius Records. The band released Screaming Bloody Murder, its last album on Island Records, in 2011 to a generally positive reception, though it fell short of its predecessors' commercial success. The band's sixth studio album, entitled 13 Voices is set for release on October 7, 2016 through Hopeless Records.</p>
		<p>The band often performs more than 300 times each year and holds long global tours, most of which last more than a year.
